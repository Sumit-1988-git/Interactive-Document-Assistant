Medical Consultant Report and Summary
Case No: MD- Physician:
Date: June 13, 2009 Medical Consultant:
1. Detailed (Chronological) Analysis:
On 11/2/2005 at approximately 18:45, a 5 month old infant with no significant past medical history, was
reported by his grandparents to have fallen off a bed hitting his head on a tile floor. They took him to the
Emergency Room at Hospital where an evaluation by the attending physician was performed,
including a skull xray read as normal. The patient was discharged, but was brought back to the
Emergency Room several hours later with increasing irritability, swelling of the scalp, and vomiting. The
same ER physician evaluated the patient and a CT of the head at 12:50 am revealed a large epidural
hematoma, acute, with mass effect and shift of the brain. A transfer request was made to
Hospital and the patient arrived at 2:33 am.
Dr. discussed the case with the resident physician on call in the hospital when the
patient arrived at Hospital, approximately seven and a half hours after the injury. His report
indicates that the patient demonstrated evidence of brainstem herniation, including presence of posturing
motor responses. The patient was treated with emergency surgical intervention, consisting of a
craniotomy to evacuate the hematoma.
At surgery, the patient was found to have a massive acute epidural hematoma consisting of
nearly a third of the inctracranial volume. Postoperatively the patient did not fully recover and suffered
significant neurological injury.
2. Proposed Standard(s) of Care:
The standard of care for an infant presenting with a history of a closed head injury, neurological
symptoms, and a large acute epidural hematoma on imaging is surgical evacuation. Generally, this is
undertaken in an urgent fashion as sudden neurological deterioration can occur even in patients who are
relatively asymptomatic on initial presentation. For large hematomas in patients with evidence of
neurological injury, emergent surgery is essential if there is to be any hope of functional recovery.
3. Deviation from the Standard of Care:
There was no deviation from the standard of care by Dr. All the parameters set forth above
were met. He was prompt in his response to the condition of the patient when he became aware of it and
his decision making was sound. There was no delay in care which would have in any way impacted on
the outcome of the patient.
4. Actual Harm Identified:
There was no actual harm to this patient from Dr. neurosurgical care.
Case No.

5. Potential Harm Identified:
Minor criticisms of the evaluation include the timeliness of access intravenously provided to the patient
and the discussion with the anesthesiologist regarding the need for transfusion. The patient did complete
surgery at the Trauma center acidotic and anemic, which would generally indicate a need for correction
through improved oxygenation and administration of blood products. However, in this case, no
preoperative levels were available and it is unclear what the condition of this patient was on arrival.
Additional evaluation was apparently performed in the Hospitals emergency department which
included a necessity for reintubation. There is no evidence that Dr. was responsible for any
delay after arrival to the emergency department.
6. Aggravating Factor(s):
None identified
7. Mitigating Factor(s):
The fact that the patient did not present to Neurosurgical attention until many hours after the injury and in
a state reflecting profound neurological injury reflects a very poor prognosis for functional recovery
despite appropriate and timely treatment.
8. Consultant’s Summary:
This evaluator feels that Dr. met the standard of care for an infant with a large epidural
hematoma by promptly arriving at the diagnosis and determining the infant’s level of profound
neurological injury. He met the standard by proceeding to emergent surgical intervention and there was
no significant delay in care which could have impacted the outcome. The criticism that he did not perform
an adequate preoperative evaluation is not appropriate, since under these circumstances prompt surgical
evacuation of the hematoma is necessary for any hope of neurological recovery to be realistic. His
actions were appropriate.
